# Flask SQLAlchemy Mock RestAPI

### Uploading my Mock RestAPI using FLASK and SQLAlchemy, Tutorial was done by Traversy Media, there were a couple tweaks to the syntax in Flask Marshmallow because of some updates

## Imports and Postman

### Imports are all included in the app.py folder, I may add a requirements.txt for what was needed in to be downloaded. All of the requirements would be downloaded in a venv.

### Flask allowed for the program to run locally, and used Postman to test all requests from the client.
